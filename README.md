# i.reddit.com-redirect
Replaces all links to reddit.com with i.reddit.com, super-lightweight version of Reddit for mobile devices. I find it extremely useful, because mobile Reddit is a slow crap and it always forces you to install their official &copy; app (most likely for easier data mining).

**Usage**
1. Install [TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net) extension into your browser.
2. Go to [OpenUserJS](https://openuserjs.org/scripts/Logarithmus/i.reddit.com-redirect) and press "Install".
3. Now try searching for reddit posts with your favourite search engine. Find a link to `reddit.com`. If you click it, you'll be forwarded to `i.reddit.com`
